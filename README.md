# Node Open Mining Portal for Riecoin (NOMP-RIC)

In development.

This is a fork of [zone117x/node-open-mining-portal](https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal), adapted to support the latest Riecoin Core versions (including Testnet network). It can either be used as a base to create new Riecoin NOMP pools, or to update current ones by porting changes from this repository.

A fork of [zone117x/node-stratum-pool](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool) adapted for Riecoin is also included in this repository (rather than being in another GitHub repository), as well as a stripped down version of [zone117x/node-multi-hashing](https://github.com/zone117x/node-multi-hashing).
